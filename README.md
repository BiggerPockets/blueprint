## the BiggerPockets product & engineering blog

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/BiggerPockets/blueprint/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

To run the site locally 

`bundle install`

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Preview your local Jekyll site in your web browser at `http://localhost:4000`.

 If you run Jekyll locally with the `--drafts` flag (e.g., `jekyll serve --drafts`), Jekyll will include any posts in the _drafts folder, just as if they were published post (but don't worry, only locally)
