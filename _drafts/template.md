Adding a post to the blueprint blog may seem daunting, but it is actually fun and easy! Read README.md,
copy and paste this post, edit its meta data and write a bit of great content.  That last step is incredibly
important but reading this post may help.  Follow these four steps to get started writing
purposeful, organized and easy to understand content!

## Decide on the main point of your post

Decide on one main point for your post. A collection of thoughts with no main point will come across as
confusing and disjointed.  It's better to write multiple shorter posts than one post with multiple purposes.

For example, this postâ€™s purpose is to teach you how to get started writing content.  If I included
my opinion on Jekyll and the process I think we should use to publish posts, I would more likely waste
your time, lose your focus and not get my purpose across.

## Decide who you are writing for

Intentionally writing content for a specific audience will help you come across as clear and concise. Since you are
writing for the blueprint blog, you will likely be targeting other professionals that create web based software.
This means that you don't need to explain concepts the way you would to your grandma and you shouldn't condense
topics as much as you would when explaining something to an executive.

## Collate ordered lists of what you want to communicate

Creating a full outline may be unnecessary; however, creating ordered lists of what you want to communicate
is one of the most impactful steps you could take. Do this even before creating headings.  In the long run this will 
likely save time and this organization will make your writing more clear.  Ordering your lists is important to
writing coherently.

## Keep it simple

My number one tip for the best post possible is to keep it simple.  The best writing is clear, straight-forward
and easy to understand.  Don't be fancy.  Be simple.
